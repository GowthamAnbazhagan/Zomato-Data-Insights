# Zomato-Data-Insights
Zomato Data Insights is a data-driven project designed to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction for a food delivery business. The project leverages Python, SQL, and Streamlit to analyze food delivery data, optimize delivery operations, and provide actionable insights into customer preferences and restaurant performance.
The primary objective is to build an interactive Streamlit app that allows seamless data management and insightful visualizations. The app supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, dynamic schema changes, and real-time data analysis.
